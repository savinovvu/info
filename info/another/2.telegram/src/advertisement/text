Hello üññ

We have created a small group (https://t.me/baikalvoiceFlooding) to practice spoken English. After all, the more you speak, the better you get! The format allows for live communication in an audio chat or simply recording audio messages. Of course, you can also evaluate other people's messages. Without feedback, it won't be interesting.

 In the group, communication with voice messages is welcomed because it is a convenient way to improve spoken English. In addition, there is a voice and video chat, as well as regular publications of interesting educational videos.

P.S. Plus, we created a page on GitHub (https://github.com/savinovvu/Baikal-Voice), where we described our methods of improving language and comments on them. Links to paid and free portals, books and services, and much more. Come in and read.
